### Kirstie

**bio**

Kirstie Whitaker is a postdoctoral researcher in the Brain Mapping Unit at the University of Cambridge. She studies adolescent brain development and is particularly interested in the emergence of mental health disorders during the teenage years. She uses network analyses to understand how different parts of the brain work work together and ensures all her analyses are reproducible by independent researchers. She's the founder and lead developer of the STEMM Role Models project which provides a database of experts from traditionally under-represented groups to ensure conference organizers are able to invite the most diverse and exciting speakers to their events.

### Danielle

**bio**

A cell biologist and Neuroscience PhD candidate at [Oregon Health and Science University](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/neuroscience-graduate-program/) passionate about improving reproducibility and digital literacy in the sciences. She studies the role of phosphoinositide signaling in myelination in her dissertation project, collects terabytes of microscopy data, loves fancy microscopes, and enjoys policy work. She co-organizes [Open Insight PDX](http://openinsightpdx.com/), which seeks to build skills that enhance research reproducibility and facilitate discussion of issues surrounding publishing, data sharing, and copyright. She is a founding member of [Women in Science Portland](http://wisportland.weebly.com/) and an organizer for [Science Hack Day Portland](http://portland.sciencehackday.org/).

### Teon

**bio**

Teon Brooks is a soon-to-be postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Reproducible Neuroscience and the Department of Psychology at Stanford University. He studies the cognitive processes and temporal dynamics of the brain during reading. He is a core developer for MNE, a community-driven project for analyzing time-series brain data in Python; and OpenEXP, an open science platform founded to be a "GitHub for Experiments" and a tool for running both behavioral and physiological experiments using open-source web-based tools.
He is also developing curriculum, DIYCogSci, for teaching experimental research methods and coding using low-cost electronics and open-source hardware.

### Bruno

**bio**

Bruno Miguel Pereira Vieira is a bioinformatics and population genomics PhD student at WurmLab (Queen Mary University of London) and Node.js web developer. Researching how genetic diversity is affected by sociality in insects (e.g., ants and bees). He founded the open source community Bionode.io with the goal of improving modularity and reusability of tools and code in bioinformatics by leveraging innovation coming from the Node.js and Web communities. 
He's involved in other open source projects such as Dat ("git for data") and BioJS ("biological data visualization on the web‚Äù).
