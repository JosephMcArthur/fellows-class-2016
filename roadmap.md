##Welcome to the 2016 Mozilla Fellows for Science Roadmap!

This roadmap provides you with a bit of structure for the fellowship. 

Over the next 10 months, you'll create amazing projects, build communities, train our next set of open science leaders, and champion working open and open science in ways that we haven't yet dreamed of and we'd like to organize those thoughts, prototypes, and projects here.

###TASKS/DELIVERABLES

We've broken the 10 month period into phases, to help you organize your time. Deliverables are for each phase of the project will be listed as that phase nears, and sorted into directories named for the phase. The deliverables will help you document your project's evolution, and make your process transparent and reusable for our wider community. 

We've assigned point people ([contact list here](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2016/blob/master/reference/contacts.md)) who can help you with questions and clarifications about the tasks listed below. We also have a directory of fellows' contacts, should you like to reach out to eachother [here](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2016/blob/master/reference/fellows.md).

See below for a timeline of the tasks for the year. All is subject to change/updating. Again, your feedback is welcome!
