##Writing and Reflection on Problem/Challenge. 

**GOAL:** The aim is to clarify your thinking about the problem or challenge, and in doing so, improve your project. You’ll be leaving aside your solution or project idea for about a half hour, and focusing the problem only. Your solution will be most effective if you’ve got a good grasp on the ins and outs of the problem, why it exists, what other solutions have been tried, etc. Here are some little exercises to get you going. (note: After you complete these exercises, you’ll write a blog post about your problem/challenge for the MSL blog. The post itself doesn’t have to be structured in this way, but doing about 30 mins of short writing exercises will provide you with material for your final draft.)

**FORMAT:** Solo writing exercise.  Use all of the time you’re allotted for each exercise. If you get stuck, try to keep going. Keeping your pen moving, free associate, don’t be judgemental, encourage any idea or thought that comes to mind. 

**TECHNOLOGY:** A timer or stopwatch to time your freewrites. Pen and paper are recommended here, over typing into a computer. 

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 to 35 mins 

1. Work from [the document](https://gist.github.com/auremoser/9461e9ea62c5b3d7b87794158db4342c) we used at onboarding 
2. Work on your Open Canvas and document your goals in your own folder.
