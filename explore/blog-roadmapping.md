##Writing a Post. 

**GOAL:** Write a blog post about the roadmap you designed for your fellowship. 

**FORMAT:** Post on MSL's blog

**TECHNOLOGY:** Wordpress. You should have usernames and logins via Aurelia. 

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 1-2 hours (depending on how fast you write!). 

Using your ideas and notes from the [goal exercise](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/goal-setting.md), write a blog post about how you will try to break down these goals.

The post should be no longer than 700 words (short and sweet). Keep the tone casual, and be sure to use jargon-free or jargon-lite lanaguage so your ideas are accesible to as many of our readers as possible. 

NOTE: DO NOT PUBLISH THE POST.  Save it as a draft, we'll publish them accordingly.
