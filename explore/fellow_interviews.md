##Interview your fellow fellow.

**GOAL:** We want our community to know about you, where you are coming from, what inspires and motivates your work in open science, and what projects or potential projects you’re excited about. As part of encouraging conversation and engagement within the Fellows cohort, we’re asking you to collaborate on these posts and interview each other.  

**FORMAT:** Interview. Each fellow interviews another for ~30 minutes; you’re interviewed by a different person than the one you interview.

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 1 hour (20 mins prep, 30 mins interviewing, 10 mins editing & admin etc)  

**TECHNOLOGY:** Recording audio via Skype may be the best option; there are a number of apps/plugins for recording audio from Skype. No-cost options for Mac are limited, but free short-term trials of software is available. If you have another solution, please let us know.
