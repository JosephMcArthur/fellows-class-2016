##Writing a Post. 

**GOAL:** Write a blog post about the fellow fellow you interviewed. 

**FORMAT:** Post on MSL's blog

**TECHNOLOGY:** Wordpress. You should have usernames and logins via Aurelia. 

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 1-2 hours (depending on how fast you write!). 

Using your ideas and notes from the [interview exercise](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2016/blob/master/fellow-interviews.md), write a blog post about what challenges/problems you hope to tackle.

The post should be no longer than 700 words (short and sweet). Keep the tone casual, and be sure to use jargon-free or jargon-lite lanaguage so your ideas are accesible to as many of our readers as possible. [Mozilla Foundation Director Mark Surman’s blog](http://marksurman.commons.ca/blog/) is a great model/resource for writing good posts. The bolded statements, the bullet points, these “action items” he uses highlighs key ideas and makes takeaways evident. Feel free to inculde images, diagrams, etc-- the more visuals the better!

NOTE: DO NOT PUBLISH THE POST.  Save it as a draft, we'll publish them after your intro interview posts go out.
