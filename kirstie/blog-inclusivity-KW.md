# Inclusivity means everyone wins

`Note - I'm crummy at titles - any suggestions very welcome :)`

Early in September, at the Mozilla office in Toronto, X people came together for their fellowship onboarding.

They were the eight Mozilla Open Web fellows [LINK], and the four Mozilla Fellows for Science [LINK].

Well, actually, that's not quite true, two of our cohort weren't able to attend in person as they weren't able to receive visas to visit Canada in time.

The onboarding week consisted of activities such as ***norm setting***, ***goal setting***, ***speed "dating"***, an ***introduction to Mozilla*** from the CEO Mark Surman [LINK], ***making zines***, brainstorming what we want to ***learn*** and what we want to ***teach***, a discussion of ***blockers*** that stop us from achieving our goals, a presentation from ***alumnus fellow*** Joey Lee [LINK], and a delightful closing circle of ***appreciations*** and promises of ***actions going forwards***.

That's a lot, right? And a very interactive program. There weren't many times where we sat and listened to a presentation. We were chosen to be there because Mozilla wanted empower us all to make a change in the world. The goal of the week was to make sure that we could be as effective as possible over the next ten months of our fellowships.

So what about our two fellows who couldn't attend in person? How did they take part?

We linked up with them via Vidyo so they could see us and we could see them.

(There were two cameras in the room, one of which was actually behind us. It took us a while but we did eventually realise that we needed to turn around to wave and say hello!)

We used a speaking cube [BETTER NAME?] that acted as a microphone to make sure they could hear us.

And we used "sparkle fingers" to indicate our support for what another participant was saying.

We also had a Mozilla team member chatting online with our two remote fellows who would relay any messages on challenges in communication or questions they had to the rest of the group.

From the first day, I was really proud of the organisers of our onboarding at the effort they put into making sure Suchana and Steffania were able to join in.

But I didn't anticipate how much the rest of us would benefit from these inclusivity measures.

One of our norms that we stated at the beginning of the week was to **step up and step down**, which means if you're not saying much in the conversation take a deep breath and join in (step up), and if you feel like you're speaking a little too much try to let others talk a little more (step down).

The speaking cube facilitated this *so well*. As we had to wait to hold the box before we could speak it really made everyone realise how much or little they were contributing to the discussion. We had a couple of people (myself included!) who recognised how often they were speaking and noticeably stepped down throughout the week. There were no empty spaces, everyone in the room had amazing points to make. I'm convinced that the speaking cube meant we had a much more balanced and diverse conversation in the room that we would have had without it.

The speaking cube also prevented us from speaking over each other. An awful lot of the time all we wanted to say was "YES! I completely agree." We replaced our words with sparkle fingers (kinda like jazz hands but more sparkly), inspired by this emoji [INSERT]. Again, it allowed us to give feedback and support to our remote fellows when we didn't have the microphone, but also to each other in the room.

The efforts the Mozilla team made to ensure we were inclusive required planning, a little technological dexterity, some flexibility and buy in from the other participants. But we didn't lose anything at all. In fact, the inclusivity efforts enhanced our safe space. ***We are a more powerful force as a result.***
